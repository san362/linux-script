Welcome to my Git repository for Linux scripts! This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of scripts that automate various tasks on Linux systems. 

The scripts included here are designed to help simplify and streamline system administration, as well as make it easier to perform common tasks such as setting up servers, managing users, and deploying applications.

All the scripts have been tested. The scripts are designed to be easy to use, with clear and well-documented instructions on how to run them.
